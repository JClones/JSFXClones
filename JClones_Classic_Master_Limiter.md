# JClones_Classic_Master_Limiter
JClones_Classic_Master_Limiter is a clone of freeware limiter plugin designed to provide transparent limiting, allowing you to maximize the loudness of your audio tracks without introducing distortion or unwanted artifacts. Simple interface, low CPU usage, and essential controls make it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced producers looking to increase the loudness of their tracks. However, the developer of the plugin disappeared from the market abruptly around 2007.

## Main Parameters

**Threshold:** Sets the level at which the limiting begins. Any signal that exceeds this threshold will be limited. Lower the threshold to apply more limiting and increase the perceived loudness of the audio.
