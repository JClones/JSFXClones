# JClones_RS124
JClones_RS124 is a clone of the first emulation of classic vari-mu compressor, originally developed in the 1960s by technical engineers of famous recording studio. This plugin captures the unique sonic characteristics and behavior of the original hardware, which was famously used on numerous iconic recordings by The Beatles and other legendary artists.

## Main Parameters

**Model:** The plugin offers three different models of the RS124 compressor, each with unique characteristics and sonic qualities. These models are based on different historical units used at Abbey Road Studios, and they capture the distinct behavior and tonal nuances of the original hardware units.

**60050A**: Known for its smooth and musical compression.

**61010B**: Features a faster attack and release time than the 60050A model.
    
**60070B**: Strikes a balance between the 60050A and 61010B models in terms of attack and release times.

**Input (Gain):** Adjusts the input level, determining how much signal is sent into the compressor.

**Release (Time):** Allows users to choose between different release times, affecting how quickly the compressor returns to its normal state after reducing gain. Original version had stepped release control with dedicated "hold" position. JClones version offers smooth release control with "hold" mode removed for better usability.

**SuperFuse:** Engages a more aggressive compression curve, useful for adding more character and intensity to the compression effect. Original hardware unit didn't have such mode.

**Output (Gain):** Controls the output level, ensuring the signal leaving the compressor is at the desired level. Original version had stepped output gain control. JClones version offers smooth output gain control for better usability.

**Box Tone:** JClones version specific. Turns off audio coloration effect.
