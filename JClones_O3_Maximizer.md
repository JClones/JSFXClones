# JClones_O3_Maximizer
JClones_O3_Maximizer is a clone of maximizer module included in a comprehensive mastering plugin released in the mid-2000s. It was widely regarded for its all-in-one approach to mastering, offering a range of tools in a single interface that could handle EQ, dynamics, limiting, and more. It became a favorite for producers and engineers looking for a versatile, cost-effective solution for in-the-box mastering.

## Main Parameters

**Threshold:** Determines the level at which the Maximizer begins reducing peaks.Lowering the threshold increases the amount of limiting applied, resulting in a louder output.

**Margin:** Sets the maximum output level of the signal. Typically set to -0.1 dB or -0.3 dB to prevent inter-sample peaks that can occur in digital systems. Ensures the output does not exceed this level.

**Character:** Controls the behavior of the Maximizer in balancing loudness and transparency. This parameter adjusts between more transparent limiting and a more aggressive approach, depending on the desired effect.

**Prevent ISP:** When the option is enabled, the Maximizer actively detects and limits potential inter-sample peaks during the limiting process. It ensures that the audio remains clean and undistorted, even after digital-to-analog conversion or compression to lossy formats.
