# JClones_Hyrax
JClones_Hyrax is a clone of a brickwall limiter module included in an open-source automatic mastering system that uses machine learning to match the characteristics of a reference track to the track you want to master. While the original limiter does offline processing of a track the algorithm was modified to work in realtime.

## Main Parameters

**Input Gain:** Adjusts the input signal level before processing.

**Threshold:** Sets the level at which the limiting begins. Any signal that exceeds this threshold will be limited. Lower the threshold to apply more limiting and increase the perceived loudness of the audio.
