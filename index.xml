{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs36 JClones_AC2\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 JClones_AC2 is a clone of a plugin designed to emulate the classic sound and behavior of analog tape machines that captures the essence of tape saturation, compression, and harmonic richness, making it an invaluable asset for adding depth, warmth, and character to digital recordings. The plugin provides a range of controls that allow users to fine-tune the tape emulation to suit various audio materials and production styles.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs32 Main Parameters\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Input Gain:} Adjusts the input signal level before processing.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Output Gain:} Sets the final output level after processing.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Auto Gain:} Engages primitive loudness compensation algorithm.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Rolloff:} Controls the attenuation of high frequencies, simulating the natural frequency response of analog tape, which tends to soften or "roll off" the high-end as part of its characteristic sound.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Bump:} Adds a distinctive low-end enhancement or "bump," reminiscent of the subtle bass lift that can occur when audio is recorded to or played back from analog tape.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Model:} Sets playback head type model:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Swiss:} Modeled after Swiss-made tape machines known for their precision and high-fidelity sound (Studer A80 mkII).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Japan-O:} Represents a tape machine from Japan, known for its balanced tonal qualities and slightly warm character (Otari MX-80).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b USA-M:} Modeled after a classic American tape machine, famous for its robust and punchy sound (MCI JH-24).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b USA-A:} Based on another renowned American tape machine, known for its aggressive saturation and strong coloration (Ampex MM-1200).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Japan-S:} Represents a Japanese tape machine with a smooth, silky sound, often used in high-quality studio recordings (Sony APR-5000).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Japan-T:} Modeled after a Japanese tape machine noted for its tight, punchy low end and clear, defined high frequencies (Tascam ATR-60).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Bias:} controls the tape bias setting, which refers to a high-frequency signal added to the audio signal before recording onto tape. Adjusting the bias affects the tonal balance, saturation, and overall character of the tape emulation.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Release:} Controls the time it takes for the dynamic processing to return to its normal state after the input signal level decreases. This is crucial in the context of tape emulation because it simulates the behavior of the tape as it responds to changes in the audio signal, affecting how the saturation and compression characteristics are applied over time.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Speed:} Tape speed: 7.5, 15 or 30 inch per second (IPS).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b EQ Type:} Allows users to choose between different equalization curves that emulate the frequency response characteristics of classic tape machines. The IEC-1 and IEC-2 options represent different International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards for tape equalization. These settings affect the overall tonal balance of the tape emulation by applying specific equalization curves commonly associated with different tape recording and playback standards.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b IEC-1:} Use this setting to add warmth and fullness to tracks, particularly those needing a boost in the low-end or a smooth high-end roll-off. It's perfect for creating a vintage tape sound with a rich bass response.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b IEC-2:} Opt for this setting when you want to maintain clarity and detail in the mid and high frequencies. It's ideal for modern productions where a crisp, bright tape effect is desired without too much low-end emphasis.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Tape:} Sets tape formulation:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Modern:} current manufacturing technologies create a tape with a much greater dynamic range than earlier formulations. These tapes have a large linear region, and hence have a smaller non-linear (saturation) 'character'. This makes for recordings as true as possible to the original material.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Vintage:} older tape mediums tend to have less dynamic range, and suffer from greater distortion/saturation. These tapes, however, have 'character' that newer ones do not, and have been used with great success in recording audio.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs36 JClones_CA2A\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 JClones_CA2A plugin is a clone of digital emulation of the legendary LA-2A optical compressor, which is highly regarded in the audio industry for its smooth and musical compression characteristics. The original plugin was developed by a company, known for their popular digital audio workstation (DAW) software. The plugin was designed to replicate the unique sound and behavior of the original hardware LA-2A, a tube-based optical compressor that became famous for its warm, natural-sounding compression. The original plugin was discontinued due to the acquisition of the development company in 2013.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs32 Main Parameters\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Peak Reduction:} This control sets the amount of compression applied to the input signal. It determines how much gain reduction occurs when the signal exceeds the threshold.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Gain:} The Gain control adjusts the output level of the signal after compression has been applied. This is often referred to as "makeup gain," as it compensates for the gain reduction caused by compression.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Mode:} This switch toggles between two different compression modes \u8212- Compress and Limit.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Compress Mode:} This mode provides a gentler, more gradual compression, suitable for smoothing out dynamic fluctuations without being overly aggressive. It is ideal for vocals, bass, and other instruments where natural-sounding compression is desired.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Limit Mode:} This mode applies a more aggressive form of compression with a higher ratio, acting more like a limiter. It is useful for more extreme dynamic control or for ensuring that peaks do not exceed a certain level, making it great for drums or transient-heavy material.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b R37:} The R37 parameter is a high-frequency sidechain emphasis control. It allows the user to adjust the sensitivity of the compressor to high-frequency content in the input signal. This control effectively alters the internal sidechain circuitry, emphasizing or de-emphasizing high frequencies, which in turn affects how the compressor responds to those frequencies.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Opto Cell:} This parameter allows users to choose between two different optical compression response modes, labeled Classic and Fast. These modes determine how quickly the plugin's compressor responds to changes in the input signal, affecting the overall character and behavior of the compression.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Classic:} The Classic mode emulates the original response characteristics of the hardware LA-2A optical compressor. This mode features a slower attack and release time, resulting in a smoother and more gradual compression effect.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Fast:} The Fast mode provides a quicker attack and release time compared to the Classic mode. This mode allows the compressor to react more swiftly to transients and dynamic changes in the input signal.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Threshold:} This control sets the level at which compression begins. When the input signal exceeds the threshold level, compression is applied. JClones specific: the parameter sets exact dB value unlike the cloned plugin, which models the hardware knob behavior.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Attack:} The attack parameter controls how quickly the compressor responds to signals that exceed the threshold. Note: the parameter is ignored in "Fixed" mode.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Release:} The release control determines how quickly the compressor stops compressing after the signal falls below the threshold. Note: the parameter is ignored in "Fixed" mode.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b A/R Select:} The parameter has three settings:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Fixed:} In Fixed mode, both the attack and release times are set to predefined values that are not adjustable. This mode is designed to provide a classic, vintage-style compression behavior that is consistent and easy to use.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Manual:} In Manual mode, users have full control over the attack and release times, allowing for precise adjustments to tailor the compressor's response to the specific audio material.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Fixed/Manual:} The Fixed/Manual mode combines elements of both Fixed and Manual modes. In this setting, the attack time is fixed at a predefined value, while the release time can be adjusted manually.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Output Gain:} This parameter allows you to increase or decrease the output level of the signal after compression has been applied. JClones specific: the parameter sets exact dB value unlike the cloned plugin, which models the hardware knob behavior.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 JClones_L2 is a clone of a highly regarded audio plugin known for its capabilities in mastering and dynamic range control. Featuring a state-of-the-art brickwall limiter with look-ahead technology, it ensures peak control and prevents clipping. Its intelligent release control adapts to the audio signal, providing smooth and transparent limiting without manual adjustments. The plugin also includes advanced dithering and noise shaping options to preserve audio quality when reducing bit depth.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs32 Main Controls\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs28 Threshold:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Function:} Sets the level at which the limiting begins.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Range:} Typically ranges from 0 dB down to -30 dB.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Usage:} Lowering the threshold increases the amount of gain reduction applied, making the audio louder but reducing its dynamic range. Start with a moderate setting and adjust according to the desired loudness and dynamic control.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs28 Ceiling (Output Ceiling):\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Function:} Determines the maximum output level after processing.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Range:} Can be set from 0 dB down to -30 dB.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Usage:} Setting the output ceiling slightly below 0 dB (commonly around -0.1 dB to -0.3 dB) prevents clipping and allows headroom for digital playback systems. Adjust based on your final output format requirements.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs28 Release:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Function:} Controls the speed at which the limiter stops reducing gain after the input signal drops below the threshold.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Range:} Ranges from 0.01 ms to 1,000 ms.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Usage:} Short release times (fast) are suitable for transient-rich material like drums but can introduce distortion if too short. Longer release times (slow) provide a smoother sound but can cause pumping. It\u8217's often effective to use the "Auto Release" (Auto Release Control) mode, which dynamically adjusts the release time to suit the incoming audio.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs32 Advanced Controls\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs28 Quantize:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Function:} Sets the target bit depth for the processed audio.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Comp (Compression):} Controls the amount of compression applied to the input signal. It essentially determines how aggressively the plugin compresses the signal once it surpasses the threshold level.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Emphasis:} Controls the frequency-dependent compression behavior by emphasizing certain frequency ranges before they hit the compression stage. This parameter essentially shapes how the compressor responds to different parts of the frequency spectrum, allowing users to accentuate or de-emphasize specific frequencies during the compression process.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Bias:} Controls the biasing of the virtual tube circuitry, affecting the tonal character and harmonic distortion of the processed audio. This parameter allows users to fine-tune the behavior of the tube emulation, resulting in different saturation characteristics and overall tonal coloration.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Amp (Amplifier):} Controls the amount of preamp gain applied to the signal before it reaches the limiter stage. This parameter influences how much of the signal is pushed into the tube emulation circuit, effectively increasing the level of saturation and harmonic distortion.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Brilliance:} Controls the high-frequency enhancement applied to the audio signal, emphasizing the "air" and brightness of the sound. This parameter allows users to add a subtle boost to the high frequencies, enhancing the clarity and presence of the processed audio.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Dry Mix:} Controls the amount of unprocessed signal mixed to the output.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Output (Gain):} Adjusts the output level.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Stereo-Link:} If activated, the amount of gain reduction on left and right channels is equal.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\b Trafo:} Simulates the effect of a vintage output transformer on the audio signal. This parameter influences the tonal coloration and harmonic enhancement by emulating the subtle saturation and character introduced by analog transformers commonly found in classic hardware equipment.\par}
